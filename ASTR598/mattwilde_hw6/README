1) 	login to hyak:
		$ ssh username@hyak.washington.edu
	
	start an interactive session using:
		# qsub -I -q build walltime=3:00:00

2) 	make sure both files in same directory and type:
 	$ python myprogram.py

 	which will call the module mergesort. It will then make 4 arrays of various lenghts of random ints (using numpy) and mergesort them. Each mergesort is timed and a plot is made comparing the time to NlogN
