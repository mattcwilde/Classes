To compile and run code on Hyak:

1) 	login to hyak:
		$ ssh username@hyak.washington.edu
	
	start an interactive session using:
		# qsub -I -q build walltime=3:00:00

2) 	make sure both files in same directory and type:
 	$ python myprogram.py

 	which will call the particle module linkedlist.

 	my program will create a linked list and add a few nodes to the head, delete a node from the head then add 3 nodes to the tail.

 	(c) we do not have a funciton: delete_at_tail() because to perform the action of deleting the tail, we would have to loop from the first node to the new last node to change its pointer to null.
