To access hyak:

1) ssh mwilde@hyak.washington.edu

2) qsub -I -q build (can add walltime=3:00:00)

3) scp your folder to your local directory (where it dumps you out)

4) python myprogram.py


Running my program.py will import a binary search tree class, generate 100 random ints, and traverse through the BST, printing them as it goes.
