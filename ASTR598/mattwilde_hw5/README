HW5:

This program creates a PriorityQueue data structure.

To compile and run code on Hyak:

1) 	login to hyak:
		$ ssh username@hyak.washington.edu
	
	start an interactive session using:
		# qsub -I -q build walltime=3:00:00

2) 	make sure both files in same directory and type:
 	$ python myprogram.py

 	which will call the module PriorityQueue. It will then create a new 
 	instance of a PriorityQueue and insert 20 random integers. It will
 	then use its method delMin() to delete the minimum and print it out
 	20 times
